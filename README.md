# taondbc_download

This project is intended to create an application to save and preserve government data that is on old government computer servers and move it to more modern storage using cloud computing.

We want to be careful to not overload these older government computer servers. 
If this app is not careful, it could create a Denial of Service Attack (DOS).  

We are working on importing data from http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ 

There are several warning messages on this website that warn against overloading their bandwidth.
